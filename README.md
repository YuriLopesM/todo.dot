# Todo.dot

A simple todo-list created using **Expo/React Native**. 

![tododot-example](https://github.com/YuriLopesM/todo.dot/assets/75103144/f16ae3fb-946d-42f1-8e9a-4eca304d262d)


## Implemented

This is a Mobile Solutions exercise for college. Checklist of things needed:

- [x] Expo/React Native
- [x] Min. 2 screens
- [x] Use **SQLite**
- [x] Checkbox when task is done _(I did this function with DoubleTap just for study)_

## Things "to-do"

I liked the idea of ​​improving a simple project, especially since I don't know much about mobile development and can expand my knowledge with this.

### To make the project better overall:

- [ ] Add Husky _(or test LeftHook)_
- [ ] Add Eslint and Prettier
- [ ] Improve async operations with database
  - [ ] Search functions/add useDebounce hook
  - [ ] Response time and sync with state   
- [ ] Create a Design using the "Tododot" palindrome
  - [ ] Create a logo
  - [ ] Create basic theme colors
  - [ ] Improve stylesheet _(maybe use Tailwind?)_
  - [ ] Change splash screen and other assets


### Challenges and next steps:

- [ ] Add more functions, like update a task, Alarm, filters [think later...]
